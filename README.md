Below are 100 interview questions and answers related to Spring and Spring Boot:

**Spring Framework:**

1. What is Spring Framework?
   - Spring Framework is an open-source Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. It facilitates building robust and flexible enterprise applications using dependency injection and inversion of control (IoC) principles.

2. What are the core modules of Spring Framework?
   - The core modules of Spring Framework are:
     - Spring Core Container
     - Spring Beans
     - Spring Context
     - Spring Expression Language (SpEL)

3. What is Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring?
   - Dependency Injection is a design pattern used in Spring to manage the dependencies between objects. It allows you to inject required dependencies into a class, rather than having the class create or look up the dependencies itself.

4. How can you achieve Dependency Injection in Spring?
   - Dependency Injection can be achieved in Spring through constructor injection, setter injection, or autowiring.

5. Explain the difference between constructor injection and setter injection.
   - Constructor injection: Dependencies are provided via a constructor when creating an object.
   - Setter injection: Dependencies are provided via setter methods after the object is created.

6. What is Inversion of Control (IoC) in Spring?
   - Inversion of Control (IoC) is a principle where the control over the creation and management of objects is shifted from the application to the Spring container.

7. What is the Spring Bean Lifecycle?
   - The Spring Bean Lifecycle consists of the following phases:
     - Instantiation: Creation of a new bean instance.
     - Initialization: Setting up the bean after properties are set.
     - Destruction: Cleanup of the bean before it is removed from the container.

8. Explain the different types of bean scopes in Spring.
   - Singleton: A single instance is shared across the entire application context.
   - Prototype: A new instance is created each time the bean is requested.
   - Request: A new instance is created for each HTTP request (only in a web-aware context).
   - Session: A new instance is created for each user session (only in a web-aware context).
   - GlobalSession: A new instance is created for each global HTTP session (only in a web-aware context).

9. How do you define a bean in Spring XML configuration?
   - Beans can be defined in the Spring XML configuration file using the `<bean>` tag.

10. What is the purpose of `@Component` annotation in Spring?
    - The `@Component` annotation is used to mark a class as a Spring bean. It tells the Spring container to create an instance of the class during component scanning.

11. What is Spring AOP?
    - Spring Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm used to separate cross-cutting concerns from the main business logic. It allows you to modularize aspects (e.g., logging, security) and apply them to multiple classes.

12. How do you enable Spring AOP in a Spring application?
    - Spring AOP can be enabled by adding the `<aop:aspectj-autoproxy>` tag to the Spring XML configuration or using the `@EnableAspectJAutoProxy` annotation with Java config.

13. What is the difference between Spring AOP and AspectJ?

    - AspectJ: It is a more powerful AOP framework and requires weaving at the bytecode level.

14. What is the purpose of the `@Autowired` annotation in Spring?
    - The `@Autowired` annotation is used to automatically inject dependencies into Spring beans. It can be applied to constructors, fields, or setter methods.

15. How does Spring handle circular dependencies?
    - Spring handles circular dependencies using lazy initialization. It creates proxy objects for circular dependencies that are populated when the real object is available.

16. What is the difference between `@Autowired` and `@Resource` annotations?
    - `@Autowired`: It is a Spring-specific annotation used for automatic dependency injection.
    - `@Resource`: It is a Java EE annotation that can also be used for dependency injection in Spring. It has additional features like specifying the resource by name.

17. What is the purpose of the `@Qualifier` annotation in Spring?
    - The `@Qualifier` annotation is used to disambiguate beans when multiple beans of the same type are available for injection.

18. What are Spring Profiles?
    - Spring Profiles allow you to configure beans based on different environments or configurations. Beans marked with a specific profile are activated only when the corresponding profile is active.

19. How do you enable Spring Profiles in a Spring Boot application?
